Node.js/npm installation. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this:

Install create-react-app globally:
First, ensure that you have create-react-app installed globally. Run the following command in your terminal:


npm install -g create-react-app
Create a new React app:
Once create-react-app is installed globally, you can create a new React app by running:


create-react-app my-activity
Use npx (recommended):
As an alternative to installing create-react-app globally, you can use npx, which comes with npm 5.2+ and higher. npx allows you to run commands without globally installing them. Try using the following command:


npx create-react-app my-activity
Verify Node.js and npm installation:
Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed and properly configured. You can check the versions installed by running:


node -v
npm -v
If these commands do not return version numbers, you may need to install or reinstall Node.js from the official Node.js website.

Add Node.js and npm to your PATH:
If node and npm are installed but not recognized in your terminal, you may need to add them to your system's PATH. Here’s how you can do it on Windows:

Open the Start Search, type in “env”, and select “Edit the system environment variables”.
In the System Properties window, click on the “Environment Variables” button.
In the Environment Variables window, under the “System variables” section, find the Path variable and select it. Click on “Edit”.
In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on “New” and add the path to your Node.js installation, typically C:\Program Files\nodejs\. Click OK to close all windows.
